# state.json canonical schema

Single source of truth for `state.json` shape. All skills and agents that read or write it (memo, continue, status, revision-mediator) reference this schema. Field-level ownership noted in comments.

```jsonc
{
  "task_id": "memo-<ISO_timestamp>-<slug>",        // owner: memo Phase 1 (write-once)
  "user_query": "<original query string>",          // owner: memo Phase 1
  "created_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",             // owner: memo Phase 1
  "language": "en",                                 // owner: memo Phase 1 (always en; plugin is English-only as of 0.0.35)

  "work_dir": "<absolute or platform-native path>", // owner: memo Phase 1 (write-once); USE FOR Read/Write/Bash filesystem operations. May be absolute in Cowork (/sessions/<id>/mnt/...).
  "rel_work_dir": "<CWD-relative form of work_dir>",// owner: memo Phase 1 (write-once); backfilled by continue/SKILL.md if missing on legacy tasks. USE FOR plain-text path display in chat ("Work directory: <path>" lines). Cowork does NOT render either relative or absolute paths as clickable inside chat text — clickability comes from artifact cards on Read/Write/Edit tool calls. This field exists purely so the user sees a short, readable path rather than the absolute Cowork mount path.
  "output_folder": "<parent of work_dir>",          // owner: memo Phase 1 (write-once); the resolved $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_OUTPUT_FOLDER / $MEMOFORGE_OUTPUT_FOLDER / fallback.

  "mode": null | "brief" | "full",                  // owner: memo Phase 1.5 (write-once after user picks via AskUserQuestion). Legacy values "quick"|"standard"|"deep" are accepted on read by continue/SKILL.md and silently migrated.
  "config": {                                        // owner: memo Phase 1 initializes to {}; visualize precheck (Phase 1) populates visualize_* keys; Phase 1.5 MERGES mode-config from `skills/memo/references/modes.md` matrix (does NOT overwrite, preserves visualize_* keys). Mid-run mode change is not supported — config is set once at Phase 1.5 and is immutable after.
    "visualize_enabled": false | true,               // owner: memo Phase 1 visualize precheck; true iff `visualize:show_widget` and `read_me` are discoverable under a namespace containing `visualize`
    "visualize_namespace": null | "<prefix>",        // owner: memo Phase 1 visualize precheck; the full tool prefix up to but not including `__show_widget`
    "researcher_set": ["statutory", "case-law", "doctrinal"],   // CANDIDATE set (mode-dependent, NOT mutated by plan.doctrine_required). Brief = ["statutory"]; Full = ["statutory","case-law","doctrinal"]. The actually-dispatched subset (doctrinal filtered out when plan says Doctrine: no) lives in state.json.dispatched_researchers — see Fix 6 candidate vs dispatched in pipeline-contract.md.
    "reviewer_list": ["logic", "clarity", "style", "citations", "counterarguments"], // subset based on mode (added at Phase 1.5); canonical form is plural. Brief = 3 reviewers (logic, citations, counterarguments); Full = all 5.
    "max_iterations": 1 | 3,                         // mode-dependent (Brief=1, Full=3); single source of truth for the revision-loop iteration cap — there is NO top-level max_iterations
    "client_polish_enabled": false | true,           // Brief = false; Full = true
    "max_client_polish": 0 | 1,                      // Brief=0, Full=1
    "template_id": "executive-brief" | "classical-memo",  // direct mode→template binding (Brief → executive-brief, Full → classical-memo). Replaces the previous `template_constraint` object with its forced/bounded/open modes. When a custom-profile `template_path` is set (see below), `template_id` still records the BOUND built-in (so classifier logic and validators keep working), but at draft/review time `template_path` is the authoritative source of structure. `template_id` is therefore always set after Phase 1.5; never null.

    // Style-profile fields (all optional, all default null). Populated at Phase 1.5
    // by the style-resolve step ONLY when ~/.claude/plugin-data/memoforge/profiles/
    // contains at least one profile AND the user picked one (vs "Standard plugin style").
    // When all four are null, the pipeline reads built-in lib/prose-style.md and
    // templates/<template_id>.md — exactly the pre-Style-Studio behaviour.
    "style_profile": null | "<profile name>",         // human-readable name (matches the directory under profiles/)
    "style_profile_path": null | "<absolute POSIX path>", // path to the profile directory

    "template_path": null | "<absolute POSIX path>",       // path to <profile>/template.md, or null if the profile has no template (rules-only without structural rules → fallback to built-in template)

    // Live-progress fields (all optional, all default false/null). Populated at Phase 1 step 3.5
    // by the live-progress precheck. The orchestrator probes whether `mcp__cowork__create_artifact`
    // and `mcp__cowork__update_artifact` are available; if both are, mints the master artifact and
    // sets live_progress_enabled = true. When enabled, heavy subagents (memo-writer, researchers,
    // reviewers, mediator, client-readiness-reviewer) emit `update_artifact` calls at their
    // internal step boundaries. v0.2.0's orchestrator-side updates were end-of-turn buffered;
    // v0.5.0 moves the calls into subagents (postmortem §9 resolved STREAMING PASS on 2026-05-25).
    "live_progress_enabled": false | true             // owner: memo Phase 1 step 3.5 (precheck)
  },
  // "heartbeat_choice" — DEPRECATED in v0.0.43. The Phase 7.5 heartbeat gate (full vs research-summary) was replaced by the source-review checkpoint, which is a text-parsed continue/cancel gate (no full/summary branch). NEW tasks do not write this field. Legacy tasks created on v0.0.42 or earlier may still have it set; `skills/continue/SKILL.md` drops it on resume and logs `legacy_field_dropped`.
  "revision_gate_choice": null | "continue",  // v0.0.44: auto-advanced by Phase 9 step 6b (no user gate). Legacy v0.0.43 value `accepted_early` no longer written but accepted on read.

  // `mode_pick_pending` is the hard gate for Phase 1.5 mode choice. It sits between `intake_questions_pending` and `planning`. /continue must NOT advance from this phase to `planning` until `state.json.mode` is set via the Phase 1.5 AskUserQuestion.
  // `research_sufficiency_followup_pending` (v0.6.3+) is a conditional gate that fires only when research-sufficiency-reviewer returns `targeted_followup_needed` AND at least one `blocking_gap.target_agent == "main-session"`. It ends the assistant turn explicitly so the user can answer follow-up questions via the visualize elicitation widget (or text fallback). At most ONE Phase 6.6 gate per task — bounded by `attempts.research_followup` (which is set to 1 atomically when the gate fires). See `skills/memo/SKILL.md` Phase 6 Branch B6a for the gate procedure, and `skills/continue/SKILL.md` §`research_sufficiency_followup_pending` for the resume procedure.

**Atomicity:** any writer of `state.json` must write to `state.json.tmp` then `mv state.json.tmp state.json` (preventing torn writes).
