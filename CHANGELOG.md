# Changelog

All notable changes to legal-memo-writer.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The version line in `README.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, the latest `dist/*.zip`, and the latest `git tag` MUST all match.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-22

**Hide internal pipeline modules from slash-command autocomplete.** Moves three "skills" out of `skills/` into a new `lib/` directory so they no longer register as `/legal-memo-writer:<name>` commands. Pipeline behaviour is unchanged.

### Why

`/legal-memo-writer:` autocomplete listed six commands, but only three (`memo`, `continue`, `status`) were user-facing entry points. The other three (`legal-memo-prose-style`, `legal-memo-docx-render`, `revision-loop`) were internal modules that `/memo` loaded via `Read` or invoked via `Bash` — they never needed a user-typed slash form. Showing them in autocomplete confused users into picking the wrong command.

Claude Code plugin SDK has no `hidden` / `user_invocable` frontmatter flag — the loader scans `skills/` and registers every `SKILL.md` as a slash command. The only reliable mechanism to remove a skill from slash autocomplete is to move it out of `skills/`. `lib/` is the conventional name for "shared modules used by the main code"; the mental model becomes "`skills/` is what the user types; `lib/` is what the pipeline reads".

### What changed

- **Moved.** `skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md` → `lib/prose-style.md`. `skills/revision-loop/SKILL.md` → `lib/revision-loop.md`. `skills/legal-memo-docx-render/` → `lib/docx-render/` (SKILL.md → README.md as maintainer doc; `scripts/md_to_docx.py` keeps its location relative to the module root, now at `lib/docx-render/scripts/md_to_docx.py`).
- **Frontmatter stripped** from `lib/prose-style.md`, `lib/revision-loop.md`, `lib/docx-render/README.md` — they are no longer skills, so the `name:` / `description:` fields would be misleading.
- **Path references updated in 18 files.** `skills/memo/SKILL.md`, `skills/continue/SKILL.md`, 7 agents (`memo-writer`, `revision-mediator`, `client-readiness-reviewer`, `style-reviewer`, `clarity-reviewer`, `logic-reviewer`, `counterargument-reviewer`), 3 templates (`classical-memo`, `executive-brief`, `research-summary-only`), 3 reference docs (`skills/memo/references/INDEX.md`, `operating-contract.md`, `pipeline-contract.md`), `README.md` (skills table split into "Skills" and "Internal library modules (`lib/`)"), `scripts/tests/test_md_to_docx_banner.py` (hardcoded `SCRIPT` path constant), and the Python script's own docstring comments.
- **`__pycache__/`** removed from the moved scripts directory (was a build artifact, never should have been on disk).
- **CHANGELOG entries for prior versions** left at their original `skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md` etc. paths — historical accuracy. Only this 0.1.1 entry uses the new `lib/` paths.

### Effect on users

`/legal-memo-writer:` autocomplete now shows three commands (`memo`, `continue`, `status`) instead of six. Pipeline behaviour is unchanged — `/memo` still loads `lib/prose-style.md` at the same Phase 3 and Phase 8 reads, still calls `lib/docx-render/scripts/md_to_docx.py` at the Phase 11 export step, still references `lib/revision-loop.md` in Phase 9.

If a user had built muscle memory for `/legal-memo-writer:legal-memo-prose-style` or `:revision-loop` to peek at internal methodology, they now open `lib/prose-style.md` or `lib/revision-loop.md` in the file viewer instead.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — **54/54 OK** (11.7s, no code-behaviour changes).
- `python lib/docx-render/scripts/md_to_docx.py` smoke-run against synthetic markdown — exit 0, valid `.docx` produced.
- Grep across the whole plugin for `skills/legal-memo-prose-style`, `skills/revision-loop`, `skills/legal-memo-docx-render` returns **0 matches in production code** (CHANGELOG retains historical references by design).
- Manifest match: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version === README badge === git tag `v0.1.1` === dist zip filename.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-22

**First public release.** Promotes the plugin from internal `0.0.x` iterations to a stable, documented `0.1.0` baseline suitable for external installation.

### Why

The `0.0.x` series captured 52 iterative refinements driven by internal testing against real legal memos (writer-side, reviewer-coverage, cross-cutting quality bundles). At `0.0.52` the plugin reached production-ready quality: six bundle overhauls landed in 0.0.52 closed the last document-global gaps (cross-section consistency, recommendation concreteness, counter-argument completeness, heading discipline, writer state visibility, length proportionality). `0.1.0` is the same code with a rewritten public-facing README, a new MIT LICENSE, and a clean release artifact for the GitHub Releases page.

### What changed

- **`README.md`** — full rewrite for public consumption. New sections: at-a-glance pipeline diagram, agent table (what each of the 15 subagents does), skills table, mode comparison (Brief vs Full), three-checkpoint UX walkthrough, output-folder resolution, MCP/web-search policy summary, customization, known limitations, repo layout.
- **`LICENSE`** — MIT license added.
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — version bumped `0.0.52` → `0.1.0`.
- **`dist/legal-memo-writer-0.1.0.zip`** — clean release build, forward-slash paths (Cowork plugin loader compatible).
- No agent prompts, skill methodology, or validator schemas changed in this release — `0.1.0` is purely the public-release packaging of `0.0.52`.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — 54/54 OK (no code changes since 0.0.52).
- Zip integrity: extracted `dist/legal-memo-writer-0.1.0.zip` and confirmed forward-slash separators throughout.
- Manifest match: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version === README badge === git tag `v0.1.0` === dist zip filename.

## 0.0.52 — 2026-05-22

**Comprehensive quality overhaul — six bundles addressing document-global gaps that per-paragraph reviewers cannot catch. Defense-in-depth at writer + reviewers + client-readiness safety net for each rule.**

### Why

Three independent audits (writer-side, reviewer-coverage, cross-cutting) found six bundles of gaps preventing the plugin from consistently producing "high-class, clear, logical" memos. Sentence-length and paragraph-length discipline (0.0.47–0.0.51) addressed individual prose units but left document-global defects un-checked: risk-score drift across sections, vague recommendations, missing inline contrary authority at medium verdicts, headings-as-questions, writer ignoring state.json mode/template/assumptions-accepted, asymmetric Analysis depth. The user-provided test memo `memo-20260521T131752Z` shipped with multiple instances of each defect type.

### What changed — by bundle

**Bundle A — Cross-section consistency.** New `## Cross-section consistency` section in `skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md`. Rules: (1) risk score identical in Exec Summary bullet, Analysis Risk line, and Conclusion item for the same subsection — no drift; (2) every Exec Summary bullet ends with `(§ N)`, every Conclusion item starts with `§ N.M:`; (3) bijection between analytical subsections and Exec Summary bullets / Conclusion items (no orphans); (4) Recommendation matrix labels every column/row with its subsection number; high-residual-risk options conflicting with `Risk: high` blocker verdicts must be labelled `consequence of ignoring the recommended path, not a viable option`. New writer self-check rule. New `logic-reviewer` blocking check (content layer: risk-score drift, orphans, matrix reconciliation). New `style-reviewer` blocking check (format layer: `(§ N)` cross-references present). New template rules in classical-memo and executive-brief.

**Bundle B — Recommendation concreteness.** New `### Recommendation concreteness (Beat 4)` subsection in prose-style SKILL inside the Risk subsection pattern. Rule: every Risk-line recommendation names an action verb (specific operational step), a condition/trigger, and an owner/accountable function. Generic verbs alone (`consider`, `ensure`, `review`, `evaluate`, `assess`, `monitor`, `be aware of`) do NOT count as action verbs. New writer self-check. New blocking checks in `style-reviewer`, `clarity-reviewer`, AND `client-readiness-reviewer` (full defense-in-depth incl. Brief-mode safety net). New template rules.

**Bundle C — Counter-argument completeness.** New `### Counter-argument framing` subsection in prose-style SKILL. Three rules: (1) `Risk: medium` / `undetermined` verdicts MUST name contrary authority inline in the justification sentence(s) and explain why analysis stands; (2) where Analysis discusses a counter-argument and resolves "does not prevail", the Risk line MUST state explicit trigger conditions that would activate the counter-argument; (3) every Material Assumption in Conclusion is either linked to a specific Open Question (with "if answered as X, re-evaluate § N" note) or explicitly labelled "immaterial — does not affect any conclusion". New writer self-check. New `counterargument-reviewer` blocking checks (`overconfidence` for medium-without-contrary-authority; `understated_risk` for counter-arg-without-triggers). New `logic-reviewer` blocking check for Material Assumption ↔ Open Question mapping. New template rules.

**Bundle D — Heading discipline.** New `### Heading discipline` subsection in prose-style SKILL §Document structure. Rules: (1) all headings (H1/H2/H3) are noun phrases — not questions ("Does X apply?"), not imperatives ("Consider the Y risk"); (2) hierarchy H1 → H2 → H3 only, no H4 in analytical sections, no skip jumps. New writer self-check. New `style-reviewer` blocking checks. New template rules.

**Bundle E — Writer state visibility.** `agents/memo-writer.md` §Inputs (v1) expanded to make `state.json` a mandatory input with explicit extraction list: `mode`, `config.template_id`, `config.max_iterations`, `intake.assumptions_accepted`, `language`. New writer rule `State-aware inputs` enumerates the obligations: mode-specific compression, template-specific structure, currency-report.json `blocking[]` source-ID avoidance, and the assumption-disclosure obligation when `intake.assumptions_accepted == false` (a sentence in Context paragraphs disclosing that intake assumptions were not user-confirmed). §Inputs (vN) extended with optional raw-reviewer-JSON read for context-disambiguation (mediator output remains primary). `skills/memo/SKILL.md` Phase 8 dispatch updated to pass `state.json` explicitly and name the fields the writer extracts. New `client-readiness-reviewer` blocking check for the assumptions-not-accepted disclosure (it reads `state.json` per its inputs list).

**Bundle F — Polish.** Three additions: (1) `clarity-reviewer` new blocking check for per-section length proportionality (any single analytical subsection > 50% of total Analysis word count is structural imbalance); (2) `style-reviewer` new blocking check for header-block query scope clarity (memo with ≥3 analytical subsections must signal multi-issue scope in the Query header line); (3) `agents/memo-writer.md` new rule for currency-blocking absence disclosure (when a canonical source in the memo's topic is on the `blocking[]` list and therefore not cited, surface a one-sentence acknowledgment in Sources or the relevant subsection to prevent reader confusion about the famous-case absence).

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — 54/54 OK expected (prompt-level changes only).
- Grep audit: each bundle's canonical rule appears in `skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md` + `agents/memo-writer.md` + ≥1 reviewer + ≥1 template + this CHANGELOG entry.
- Dry-run against `memo-20260521T131752Z/drafts/v3.md`:
  - **A**: Section 7 Exec Summary "Risk: high. launch blocker" vs Recommendation matrix "Aggressive: launch anyway" → blocking under matrix-reconciliation rule.
  - **B**: "Verify DPF status pre-launch" lacks owner → blocking under vague-recommendation rule.
  - **C**: Article 22 Section 4 Risk line ("Risk: medium … fact-fragile") would carry triggers but the inline-on-Risk-line discipline is now mandatory (currently they sit in a paragraph above).
  - **D**: all v3 headings comply — no over-fire.
  - **E**: `state.json.intake.assumptions_accepted == false` (per the user's state) — new client-readiness-reviewer check would flag the missing Context disclosure.
  - **F**: Section 3 word count is ~30% of Analysis — within 50% cap; passes.
- No schema changes to `validate_review_json.py` or `validate_state.py` — new findings ride existing `blocking_issues[]` arrays with established `attack_vector` enum values (`overconfidence`, `understated_risk`) for counter-argument-reviewer additions.

## 0.0.51 — 2026-05-22

**Enforce paragraph-length discipline as a blocking issue — closes the "wall of text" gap that the sentence cap alone could not catch.**

### Why

After 0.0.47 made sentence length a blocking issue (40 words / 2 independent ideas), it became clear the sentence cap alone does not deliver readable prose: a paragraph can satisfy every sentence rule individually yet still be a 5-sentence / 270-word brick of dense legal analysis. The user pointed at one such paragraph in `memo-20260521T131752Z` Section 3.2 (Article 6(1)(f) analysis) — 5 sentences, ~270 words, three different cumulative-condition tests stacked into one paragraph, three citation clusters, no visual break for the reader.

No prose-style file, no reviewer prompt, and no template currently constrained paragraph length. The templates said "1-3 short paragraphs" qualitatively but no reviewer checked the cap, so "short" drifted into "as long as I want as long as no single sentence exceeds 40 words".

User decision: same defense-in-depth pattern as the sentence rule (writer self-check + both reviewers + client-readiness as Brief-mode safety net) with a tight threshold of **3 sentences and 100 words** per paragraph.

### What changed

- **`skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md`** — new top-level `## Paragraph structure — short, single-idea, easy to skim` section parallel to `## Sentence structure`. Includes a `### Hard limits` subsection with the 3-sentences / 100-words cap, the exemption list (blockquote, bullets, numbered list items, headings, titles, table cells), and the enforcement contract (style + clarity + client-readiness all treat violations as blocking).
- **`agents/memo-writer.md` §Rules** — new `Paragraph-length self-check (hard rule, blocking at review)` bullet added immediately after the existing sentence-length self-check. Writer must scan every authored prose paragraph per-section and split anything over the cap. Explicitly names the three reviewers that enforce it.
- **`agents/style-reviewer.md` §Sentence and tone discipline** — new `Long packed paragraphs (blocking)` check added next to the existing `Long packed sentences` check. Same blocking-issues output shape: paragraph quoted as `<first 15 words> … <last 10 words>` with a concrete split suggestion.
- **`agents/clarity-reviewer.md` §What you check** — new `Paragraph length (blocking)` check parallel to the existing `Sentence length` check. Framed around the target reader (non-lawyer business stakeholder) — "wall of text" defeats accessibility.
- **`agents/client-readiness-reviewer.md` §Checks** — new `Paragraph-length cap (final safety net)` check parallel to the existing `Sentence-length cap`. Same Brief-mode rationale: Brief disables style + clarity, so client-readiness is the only post-draft gate for paragraph discipline in Brief.
- **`templates/classical-memo.md` and `templates/executive-brief.md` §Rules** — new `Paragraph-length cap (hard, blocking at review)` bullet added after the sentence-length cap. Executive-brief notes that the cap rarely binds for the already-compressed template but is enforced uniformly.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — 54/54 OK (prompt-level changes only; no Python or schema changes).
- Targeted re-grep: paragraph rule appears in 7 files (prose-style SKILL, memo-writer, style-reviewer, clarity-reviewer, client-readiness-reviewer, classical-memo, executive-brief).
- Manual dry-run against `memo-20260521T131752Z/drafts/v3.md` §3.2 paragraph 3 (the 5-sentence, ~270-word "EDPB frames the same test" paragraph): under the new prompts both `style-reviewer` and `clarity-reviewer` would route this to `blocking_issues[]`, the mediator passes it through, and the writer splits it on the next revision.

## 0.0.50 — 2026-05-22

**Numbered lists get the same paragraph overrides as bullets, and both disable Word's `contextualSpacing` so the 6pt after-spacing applies between items.**

### Why

After 0.0.49 unified bullet indents to `<w:ind w:left="720"/>`, two follow-ups surfaced:

1. **Numbered lists were inconsistent with bullets.** 0.0.49 kept numbered lists on the style default (left=360 with `firstLine=0`) — visually narrower than the deeper bullet indent. The user pointed out they should match, so the renderer's output looks the same regardless of whether the markdown uses `-` or `1.`.
2. **Items of the same list style were too tight.** Word's built-in `ListBullet` and `ListNumber` styles ship with `<w:contextualSpacing/>` set in `styles.xml`, which is the "Don't add space between paragraphs of the same style" checkbox in the Paragraph dialog. The result is 0pt spacing between consecutive list items even though `space_after = Pt(6)` is set. The user wants normal 6pt after-spacing between list items, so this style flag has to be overridden at the paragraph level.

### What changed

- **`skills/legal-memo-docx-render/scripts/md_to_docx.py`**:
  - New helper `_disable_contextual_spacing(paragraph)` injects `<w:contextualSpacing w:val="0"/>` into the paragraph's `pPr` in the correct schema slot (after `w:ind`, before `w:jc`). This overrides the inherited `contextualSpacing=true` from Word's built-in list styles and restores the 6pt after-spacing between items.
  - `add_list_item` no longer branches on `ordered`: both bullets and numbered lists now receive the same three paragraph overrides:
    1. `left_indent = INDENT_LEFT_LIST` (720 DXA)
    2. `_clear_inherited_tab(p, 360)` (clear inherited tab at the default marker position)
    3. `_disable_contextual_spacing(p)` (turn off `contextualSpacing` flag)
  - `first_line_indent` is no longer set explicitly for numbered lists either — the inherited hanging=360 from `ListNumber` stays in effect, so the number sits at 360 DXA and wrapped text starts at 720 DXA, exactly mirroring bullets.
- **`skills/legal-memo-docx-render/SKILL.md` §Paragraph types** — bullet and numbered rows rewritten so both reference the same `<w:ind>` + tab clear + `contextualSpacing="0"` triplet. The note "Same paragraph overrides as bullets" makes the parity explicit for future maintainers.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — 54/54 OK (prompt-level + XML-injection changes; no Python schema or state.json changes).
- Re-rendered `memo-20260521T131752Z/drafts/v3.md` and inspected the output XML against the source draft (1 Executive Summary section + Material assumptions + Open questions + Sources = 25 bullets, 15 numbered items):
  - **Bullets**: 25/25 carry `w:left="720"`, tab clear at 360, `contextualSpacing="0"`, `jc=both`.
  - **Numbered**: 15/15 carry the same four attributes.
  - Element order in `pPr` is schema-correct: `pStyle → spacing → tabs → ind → contextualSpacing → jc`.

## 0.0.49 — 2026-05-22

**Match the canonical bullet indent: `<w:ind w:left="720"/>` + tab clear at 360, applied on top of `ListBullet` style.**

### Why

Inspection of `memo-20260521T131752Z-gdpr-ai-support-transcripts/memo-gdpr-ai-support-transcripts.docx` showed the user had manually edited ONE bullet (in `## 1. Executive summary`) to add `<w:ind w:left="720"/>` and `<w:tab w:val="clear" w:pos="360"/>` on top of the inherited `ListBullet` style. The other 24 bullets in the same docx retained `md_to_docx.py`'s default output (no `w:left` override, just `w:firstLine="0"`). The user pointed at the edited bullet as the canonical visual style and asked the renderer to apply it everywhere.

Default `python-docx` rendering of `add_paragraph(style="List Bullet")` inherits `<w:ind w:left="360" w:hanging="360"/>` from `numbering.xml`. The marker sits at the left margin, wrapped text at 360 DXA. The Cowork visual spec puts the marker deeper (at 360 DXA, after a 0.25" gap from the margin) and wrapped text at 720 DXA, so bullets are visually distinct from body paragraphs (whose first-line indent is 630 DXA).

### What changed

- **`skills/legal-memo-docx-render/scripts/md_to_docx.py`**:
  - New constant `INDENT_LEFT_LIST = Cm(1.27)` (720 DXA = 0.5") with explanatory comment.
  - New helper `_clear_inherited_tab(paragraph, pos_dxa)` that injects `<w:tabs><w:tab w:val="clear" w:pos="N"/></w:tabs>` into the paragraph's `pPr` in the correct schema position (before `w:ind`). Used to clear the inherited tab at 360 DXA so wrapped lines do not snap back to the old marker position.
  - `add_list_item` now branches on `ordered`:
    - **Bullets (`ordered=False`)**: applies `left_indent=INDENT_LEFT_LIST`, calls `_clear_inherited_tab(p, 360)`. Does NOT touch `first_line_indent` so the hanging=360 from `ListBullet` style stays in effect — marker at 360 DXA, wrapped text at 720 DXA. Matches the user's edited bullet byte-for-byte (minus auto-added spacing attributes that are inert).
    - **Numbered lists (`ordered=True`)**: unchanged. Keeps `first_line_indent=Cm(0)`, inherits left=360 from style. Mirrors the Sources section in the source docx where the user did NOT override.
- **`skills/legal-memo-docx-render/SKILL.md` §Paragraph types** — spec-table rows for bullet and numbered list rewritten to document the new override pattern explicitly, with the exact OOXML attributes a future maintainer needs to reproduce or audit.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — 54/54 OK.
- Re-rendered the source draft `memo-20260521T131752Z/drafts/v3.md` with the new code and inspected the output XML:
  - **25/25 ListBullet paragraphs** now carry `<w:ind w:left="720"/>`. (Previously: 1/25, only the user's manual edit.)
  - **25/25 carry `<w:tab w:val="clear" w:pos="360"/>`.** (Previously: 1/25.)
  - All bullets retain `<w:jc w:val="both"/>` (justified) and the standard Arial 12pt run formatting.
  - Numbered list (Sources section) unchanged — still uses default left=360 with `<w:ind w:firstLine="0"/>`.

## 0.0.48 — 2026-05-22

**Unify the section-structure contract for `classical-memo`; enforce Executive Summary bullets-only discipline.**

### Why

Same user-generated memo as 0.0.47 (`memo-20260521T131752Z-gdpr-ai-support-transcripts`) shipped with two more structural defects that v0.0.47 did not catch:

1. **Facts mixed into `## 1. Executive summary`.** Two prose paragraphs (the company's SaaS facts; the transcript / assumption details) followed the Exec Summary bullets within Section 1, rather than living in the prescribed `## 3. Facts, assumptions and limitations` section or in the unnumbered Context paragraphs above `## 1.`. The memo had no separate Facts section at all.
2. **Exec Summary bullets too long (4 sentences each).** Each bullet was effectively a small analytical paragraph with `Risk: <level>` appended, indistinguishable in shape from body paragraphs.

Root cause: **four different files specified four conflicting structures** for `classical-memo`:

| File | What it said |
|------|--------------|
| `templates/classical-memo.md` | 9 sections incl. Exec Summary, Background, Facts, Analysis. |
| `agents/memo-writer.md` (Memorandum structure list, lines 60-72) | 7 sections, **no Exec Summary, no Facts**. |
| `agents/memo-writer.md` (worked skeleton, lines 76-129) | Started numbered sections at `## 1. Background and definitions`. |
| `agents/memo-writer.md` (line 138 deviation note) | `## 1. Exec Summary` then Background then Analysis at `## 2+` — **no Facts mentioned**. |

The writer faithfully resolved the conflict by skipping the disputed sections (Context and Facts) and folding their content into Section 1 prose tail. No reviewer caught this because no reviewer checked section structure beyond the four-beat Risk pattern inside analytical subsections.

### What changed

- **`agents/memo-writer.md` §Memorandum structure (was lines 60-72)** — rewritten as a 9-item authoritative list for classical-memo, with explicit numbered-vs-unnumbered marking. Context paragraphs are unnumbered and sit between the Header block and `## 1.`. `## 1. Executive Summary` is bullets-only (3-5 bullets, each ≤ 2 sentences and ≤ 40 words, no prose). `## 2. Background and definitions` is optional. `## 3. Facts, assumptions and limitations` is **required**. Analytical subsections start at `## 4.` (or `## 3.` if Background is skipped).
- **`agents/memo-writer.md` worked skeleton (was lines 74-129)** — replaced with a skeleton showing the new numbering, an explicit `## 1. Executive Summary` block with bullets-only example, an explicit `## 3. Facts, assumptions and limitations` block, and analytical subsections starting at `## 4.`. The skeleton no longer contradicts the structure list.
- **`agents/memo-writer.md` classical-memo deviation note (was line 138)** — simplified to point at the new skeleton and explicitly list the required numbered sections with the "if Background skipped" renumbering rule.
- **`skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md` §Document structure** — expanded from 7 to 9 sections to match the template. Adds Executive Summary (classical-memo only) and Facts/assumptions/limitations entries. Clarifies which sections are numbered vs unnumbered and how numbering shifts when Background is skipped.
- **`templates/classical-memo.md` §Required sections** — Section 4 (Executive Summary) instruction rewritten to say "bullets ONLY, no prose, each bullet ≤ 2 sentences and ≤ 40 words". §Rules expanded with two new blocking rules: (a) Executive Summary discipline (no prose in `## 1.`) and (b) Facts section required.
- **`agents/style-reviewer.md` §Structural elements** — two new blocking checks:
  - **Executive Summary content discipline.** Reviewer detects `**Template:** classical-memo` in the header block; if present and `## 1. Executive Summary` exists, any body paragraph inside that section is a blocking defect (must move to Context or Facts). Each Exec Summary bullet must also be ≤ 2 sentences and ≤ 40 words (the 0.0.47 §Sentence structure Hard limits rule applied per bullet).
  - **Facts section presence.** Classical-memo must have a `## N. Facts, assumptions and limitations` section. Missing Facts is blocking.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/tests` — 54/54 OK (prompt-level changes only; no Python or schema changes).
- Grep `worst 1-2 offenders per memo as non-blocking` and `sentences >40 words with three or more subordinate clauses → flag` — zero matches outside CHANGELOG history.
- Manual dry-run against the offending memo `memo-20260521T131752Z`: under the new style-reviewer prompt, v3 Section 1 would now produce TWO blocking issues — "prose paragraph inside `## 1. Executive Summary` (move to `## 3. Facts, assumptions and limitations` or Context)" and "Facts section missing" — both reach the writer via the mediator.

## 0.0.47 — 2026-05-22

**Enforce sentence-length discipline as a blocking issue — fixes the "approved memo with 88-word sentences" gap.**

### Why

User-generated memo `memo-20260521T131752Z-gdpr-ai-support-transcripts` shipped `final_status: approved` with multiple 80-90 word sentences chaining 3+ independent ideas via `and that …, and that …` — exactly the construction `skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md §Sentence structure` says to avoid. The trace through the review artefacts showed the failure was systemic, not a single agent miss:

1. `clarity-reviewer.md` detected `>40 words with 3+ subordinate clauses` but routed it to `nice_to_have[]`.
2. `style-reviewer.md` flagged long packed sentences only as `non-blocking` (worst 1-2 per memo); promotion to blocking required `>5 in one section`.
3. `revision-mediator.md` drops every `nice_to_have` finding before handoff to the writer (a sound policy for genuine cosmetics).
4. The writer therefore never received a "split this sentence" instruction. v1 → v2 → v3 left the 88-word Section 4 sentence intact even though the mediator's "Ignored" section explicitly noted it on all three iterations.

The fix is defense in depth at a hard threshold (40 words / 2 independent ideas) — prevention at the writer plus enforcement at both reviewers.

### What changed

- **`skills/legal-memo-prose-style/SKILL.md` §Sentence structure** — added a new `### Hard limits` subsection naming the 40-word / 2-idea cap, the verbatim-quote exemption, and the enforcement contract (style + clarity treat violations as blocking, not nice-to-have).
- **`agents/memo-writer.md` §Rules** — new `Sentence-length self-check (hard rule)` bullet added before the house-style bullet. Writer must scan every authored sentence per-section and split anything over the cap before moving to the next section. The house-style bullet now points explicitly at `§Sentence structure Hard limits` so the reference is not ambiguous.
- **`agents/style-reviewer.md` Sentence and tone discipline** — `Long packed sentences` rule rewritten. Was "flag worst 1-2 as non-blocking; >5 in section as blocking". Now: any sentence >40 words OR chaining >2 independent ideas is a `blocking_issues[]` entry with the offending sentence quoted and a concrete split suggestion. Verbatim source quotes exempted.
- **`agents/clarity-reviewer.md` What you check** — `Sentence length` rule rewritten. Was `→ flag` (defaulted to `nice_to_have`). Now: `blocking_issues[]` with verbatim quote and split suggestion. Same threshold as style-reviewer (40 words OR 3+ subordinate clauses). Verbatim source quotes exempted.
- **`templates/classical-memo.md` and `templates/executive-brief.md` §Rules** — new `Sentence-length cap` bullet added so the cap is visible at template level, not only inside the prose-style skill. Existing "Short declarative sentences" guidance retained.
- **`agents/client-readiness-reviewer.md` §Checks** — added a `Sentence-length cap (final safety net)` check. Closes a Brief-mode gap: Brief runs only `logic` + `citations` + `counterarguments` (style and clarity are disabled), so without this addition Brief mode had no enforcement of sentence discipline. The client-readiness reviewer is the only post-draft prose gate in Brief; in Full mode it is a redundant third line of defense after style + clarity. Violations are emitted as `verdict: needs_final_polish` (the writer can split sentences in a single polish pass — no new research needed). Same exemption for verbatim source quotes.

### What did NOT change

- **Mediator's `Ignore all nice_to_have` policy** — unchanged. Long-sentence violations are not filtered now because they no longer land in `nice_to_have[]`; they land in `blocking_issues[]` and reach the writer through the existing path.
- **No new Python pre-check or word-counter script.** LLM reviewers can count words; a Python guard would be redundant maintenance.
- **No new reviewer kind.** Existing `style` + `clarity` set already owns prose; adding a third would inflate the mediator surface.
- **`md_to_docx.py` and the export pipeline** — untouched. This is a prompt-level fix only.

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest scripts.tests.test_md_to_docx_banner` — still 4/4 green (no Python or schema changes).
- Targeted re-grep for the old rule strings (`worst 1-2 offenders per memo as non-blocking`, `sentences >40 words with three or more subordinate clauses → flag`) returns zero hits outside CHANGELOG history.
- Manual dry-run against `memo-20260521T131752Z`'s `drafts/v3.md` Section 4 88-word sentence: under the new prompts both reviewers route it to `blocking_issues[]`, the mediator passes it through, and the writer is told to split.

**Rename the two confusingly-named style skills to disambiguate prose vs. docx.**

### Why

The plugin shipped two skills with near-identical names (`legal-memo-style` and `legal-memo-house-style`) and overlapping `description:` fields. Both shared the `legal-memo-` prefix and the word `style`; the first was about docx rendering (Arial 12pt, margins, banners) and the second was about prose conventions (tone, four-beat Risk pattern, anti-AI-tells). They cross-referenced each other in the body, but at the skill-picker level the names were indistinguishable. Users (and the model itself, when auto-invoking) could not tell which one to read for which purpose.

### What changed

- `skills/legal-memo-style/` → **`skills/legal-memo-docx-render/`** (visual / docx rendering — invokes `scripts/md_to_docx.py`).
- `skills/legal-memo-house-style/` → **`skills/legal-memo-prose-style/`** (prose playbook — tone, structure, reviewer-conflict priorities).
- Both `name:` frontmatter fields, the H1 of the docx-render SKILL.md, and the cross-references inside both SKILL.md bodies updated to the new names.
- Both `description:` strings rewritten so each one explicitly names its sibling skill with a "not this" clause — fixes the picker-collision problem.
- Path strings updated across `agents/memo-writer.md`, `agents/revision-mediator.md`, `agents/client-readiness-reviewer.md`, all three `templates/*.md`, `skills/memo/SKILL.md`, `skills/memo/references/INDEX.md`, `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md`, `skills/memo/references/operating-contract.md`, `skills/continue/SKILL.md`, the docx-render Python script docstring, `scripts/tests/test_md_to_docx_banner.py`, and `README.md`.
- External Cowork-archive reference `legal-memo-style 11.skill` (with space — a literal filename in the user's Cowork org) preserved unchanged everywhere it appears, since that is a different artifact from the plugin's skill.
- CHANGELOG history (entries below this one) preserved unchanged.

### Migration

- No state-schema or runtime behaviour changes. In-flight tasks continue without migration — the new skill directories carry the same content; only the names changed.
- Existing dist zips are not renamed; the 0.0.46 zip (when built) will use the new directory names.

## 0.0.45 — 2026-05-22

**Breaking change: pipeline modes reduced from three to two; output templates reduced from five to two.**

### Why

Analysis of the three-mode pipeline (Quick / Standard / Deep) showed that the Quick→Standard step was a real change (1 vs 3 researchers, 3 vs 5 reviewers, 1 vs 3 iterations, polish off vs on) but Standard→Deep was cosmetic — one extra forced follow-up that overrode the sufficiency reviewer's `sufficient` verdict, one extra polish pass, two more allowed templates. In practice it was a binary preliminary/full decision with a marginal third tier. Bundling research depth, review thoroughness, and output format into one knob also forced compromises (no way to ask for thorough research with short output, or vice versa).

The five templates `executive-brief`, `classical-memo`, `risk-assessment`, `regulatory-analysis`, `cross-jurisdictional` shared the same four-beat Risk subsection pattern; the latter three were variants of `classical-memo` with reordered sections. Carrying all five complicated the classifier and the docx renderer without adding meaningful output diversity.

### What changed

- **Modes**: three → two.
  - **Brief** (was Quick): 1 statutory researcher, 3 reviewers (logic/citations/counterarguments), 1 iteration, no client polish, `executive-brief` template, 1200-word hard cap.
  - **Full** (was Standard / Deep merged): 3 researchers (statutory + case-law + doctrinal when plan flags it), 5 reviewers, 3 iterations, 1 client polish pass, `classical-memo` template.
- **Templates**: five → two. `risk-assessment`, `regulatory-analysis`, `cross-jurisdictional` removed from disk. `executive-brief` and `classical-memo` retained.
- **`config.template_constraint` (object with `forced`/`bounded`/`open` modes and `allowed_set`) removed.** Replaced with a direct `config.template_id` string. The classifier no longer picks the template — it is bound to the mode.
- **`config.targeted_followup_forced` removed.** Deep mode's forced-followup-after-sufficient-verdict override is gone; the sufficiency reviewer's verdict is now honoured verbatim.
- **`max_client_polish` clamped to {0, 1}.** Deep mode's second polish pass is gone.
- **Phase 4a (plan edit categories)**: "Switch template or scope" option removed. To switch templates, cancel and rerun in the other mode.

### Migration (in-flight tasks)

The `continue` skill runs a silent migration on resume:
- `mode: "quick"` → `"brief"`; `mode: "standard" | "deep"` → `"full"`.
- `config.template_constraint` and `config.targeted_followup_forced` are dropped.
- `config.template_id` is backfilled from the mode (or from the removed `template_constraint.template_id`).
- `classification.selected_template_id` of the deleted templates is remapped to `classical-memo`.
- `config.max_client_polish > 1` is clamped to `1`.
- Logged as `state_migrated_legacy_modes` event in `events.jsonl`.

`md_to_docx.py` retains backward-compat for the deleted `template_id` values so already-exported archived state.json entries still render correctly.

### Files removed

- `templates/risk-assessment.md`
- `templates/regulatory-analysis.md`
- `templates/cross-jurisdictional.md`

### Files significantly rewritten

- `skills/memo/references/modes.md` — 2-row matrix, Brief/Full prose.
- `scripts/validate_state.py` — `VALID_MODES`, `MODE_*` constants, cross-field checks.
- `scripts/tests/test_validate_state.py` — 36 tests, all on Brief/Full fixtures.

## 0.0.44 — 2026-05-21

Removes the three remaining post-parallel-Task AskUserQuestion gates inside the drafting + revision + polish block. Combined with the v0.0.43 source-review checkpoint, the pipeline now has exactly **one** user touchpoint between research and final docx — `continue` at source-review — and runs fully autonomously after that.

### Why

v0.0.43 fixed Phase 7.5 (heartbeat → source-review checkpoint with explicit end-of-turn) but left three more AskUserQuestion calls downstream:
- Phase 9 step 6b — end-of-iteration gate (`Continue iter N+1` / `Accept v<N>`)
- Phase 9 step 6c — forced-exit gate (`Continue to client-readiness` / `Export as-is`)
- Phase 10 — pre-polish gate (`Apply polish` / `Export as-is`)

All three fire post-parallel-Task in plugin-skill context and hit the same documented Cowork silent-fail bug (Anthropic issues #26805 / #29773 / #29547 / #33564 / #44776). In production a v0.0.43 Standard-mode run would have hung 3–5 times between source-review and final docx — each time requiring the user to type something to force chat re-render before they could see and click the invisible modal.

User direction (verbatim, in Russian): "вся ревизия одним прогоном, иначе смысл какой в агентах" — the value of multi-agent orchestration is autonomous execution.

### What changed

- **Phase 9 step 6b (end-of-iteration gate) — REMOVED.** When mediator verdict is `needs_revision` and budget remains, the pipeline auto-advances to the next iteration. Writes `revision_gate_choice = "continue"`, emits `gate_auto_advanced` event for audit, dispatches memo-writer for v<N+1>. No user input.
- **Phase 9 step 6c (forced-exit gate) — REMOVED.** When mediator verdict is `forced_exit_on_v<N>_with_remaining_issues`, the pipeline auto-advances to Phase 10 client-readiness (always — no "Export as-is" option). The unresolved-blockers banner from mediator is in `fallback_banners[]` and surfaces in the docx regardless.
- **Phase 10 pre-polish gate — REMOVED.** When client-readiness verdict is `needs_final_polish` and polish is enabled (Standard/Deep) and budget remains, the pipeline auto-applies polish (dispatch memo-writer polish pass + re-run client-readiness reviewer). Loops until verdict is `client_ready` or budget exhausted.

- **Pre-source-review heads-up extended** to set user expectations: after `continue` at source-review, the pipeline runs ~15–40 min of visual silence in chat (drafting + revision + polish + export all in one assistant turn). User monitors via the TodoWrite side panel. Final flush happens at end-of-turn when the docx is written.

- **`gate_auto_advanced` event** added (audit-only, Tier-2). Same `gate_name`/`chosen` shape as `gate_answered` but with `reason: "<mediator_needs_revision_with_budget | mediator_forced_exit | needs_final_polish_with_budget>"`. Fires at each former gate to preserve the audit trail of the decision the orchestrator made automatically.

- **State-schema fields deprecated** but kept for backward-compat on resume: `revision_gate_choice`, `client_readiness_gate_choice`, `polish_gate_choice` — values still written (always `continue` / `apply`) so legacy validators don't fail, but no user gate produces them. Legacy values `accepted_early` / `skip_polish` / `skip` are accepted on read; the `skip_polish` value is normalised to `continue` on resume with a `legacy_value_migrated` event.

- **`continue/SKILL.md`** updated: the `revision_loop` and `client_readiness` resume branches mirror the auto-advance logic — no AskUserQuestion replay, no pre-polish gate replay.

### Tradeoffs accepted

1. Chat appears frozen for the full ~15–40 min post-source-review block (the TodoWrite panel is the only live signal).
2. No "accept v<N> early" — pipeline runs all iterations until mediator approves or `max_iterations` is reached.
3. No "export as-is" at forced exit — pipeline always runs client-readiness (with the banner).
4. No per-task "skip polish" — to disable polish, the user picks Quick mode upstream at Phase 1.5 (which sets `client_polish_enabled = false`).

If any of these become a problem in production, the gates can be re-added later as text-parsed end-of-turn checkpoints (the same pattern as v0.0.43 source-review). That alternative was scoped, drafted, and explicitly rejected during planning in favour of full autonomy.

### Files touched

- `skills/memo/SKILL.md` — Phase 5 heads-up extended; Phase 9 step 6 rewritten (auto-advance per verdict, no AskUserQuestion); Phase 10 pre-polish rewritten (auto-apply, no AskUserQuestion).
- `skills/continue/SKILL.md` — `revision_loop` and `client_readiness` resume branches simplified to mirror auto-advance.
- `skills/memo/references/events-contract.md` — added `gate_auto_advanced` event docs; updated `gate_answered` to drop `revision-iter` / `revision-forced-exit` / `polish` names; updated Phase 9/10 transition descriptions.
- `skills/memo/references/operating-contract.md` — AskUserQuestion usage table and "When to ask approval" list updated to remove Phase 9/10 entries.
- `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md` — Phase 9/10 rows updated: Gates column now "none — auto-advance per verdict".
- `skills/memo/state-schema.md` — three gate-choice fields marked deprecated; new tasks write only `continue` / `apply`.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `README.md`: version `0.0.44`.

### Verification

In a Cowork session: run `/legal-memo-writer:memo "<query>"`, approve the plan, let research run, type `continue` at the source-review checkpoint. The chat then goes quiet for ~15–30 minutes while the side panel cycles through items #10 → #11 (with iteration N updates) → #12 (with polish updates if applicable) → #13 → #14. At the end of Phase 12, the assistant turn ends, Cowork flushes the entire audit trail at once, and the final docx artifact card appears.

## 0.0.43 — 2026-05-21

Cowork dead-stuck fix: Phase 7.5 replaced with an explicit end-of-turn source-review checkpoint. Addresses the failure mode where v0.0.42 reached "Awaiting heartbeat confirmation" in the side panel but the chat remained frozen on the Phase 5 parallel-agent tile with the AskUserQuestion modal silently invisible.

### Root cause

Cowork's chat renderer only flushes assistant text on three triggers: end-of-assistant-turn, user input, or specific side-surface tool calls (TodoWrite → side panel). After a parallel Task batch, assistant text + AskUserQuestion modals + visualize widgets all buffer until one of those triggers fires. Documented Anthropic GitHub issues #26805, #29773, #29547, #33564, #44776 — all closed without upstream fix. The previous pipeline kept the assistant turn alive from Phase 5 dispatch through Phase 12 export (one giant turn), so chat never flushed mid-pipeline; AskUserQuestion at Phase 7.5 fired into a stuck-buffer state where the modal was in the DOM but not painted.

### Fix

- **Phase 7.5 rewritten.** No more AskUserQuestion. The new checkpoint: Read source-pack and currency-report (Cowork artifact cards), print a 📋 source digest + `continue`/`cancel` text instructions, then END THE ASSISTANT TURN EXPLICITLY. End-of-turn is Cowork's documented flush trigger; it paints all buffered Progress blocks from Phases 5/6/6.5/7 + the digest at once.
- **Phase 8 in-session resume parser.** Phase 8 now opens with a parse step that reads the user's reply at `current_phase == source_review_pending`. `continue` (or proceed/go/draft/yes/ok) → `current_phase = drafting`; `cancel` (or stop/abort/no) → `current_phase = cancelled_by_user`; anything else → re-show the checkpoint. Cross-session resume via `/legal-memo-writer:continue <task_id> [continue|cancel]` is handled by `continue/SKILL.md`.
- **New phase value `source_review_pending`** added to the canonical state.json enum, replacing the deprecated `heartbeat_pending`. Continue skill auto-migrates v0.0.42 tasks (drops `heartbeat_choice` field, emits `legacy_phase_migrated`).
- **Phase 5 heads-up strengthened.** New paragraph explicitly explains the silent inter-phase block and the source-review checkpoint as the flush point — pre-warns the user instead of leaving them confused.
- **TodoWrite item #9 renamed** "Heartbeat checkpoint" → "Source review" with activeForm `"Awaiting source review confirmation"`.

### Research-summary mode removed

The Phase 8 Branch A research-summary-only path was deleted as part of this simplification. The pipeline now always runs the full path (drafting + revision + client-readiness + export). The `templates/research-summary-only.md` file remains on disk as vestigial; legacy tasks resumed with `heartbeat_choice == "research_summary_only"` migrate silently to the full path (`legacy_mode_migrated` event). The v0.0.42 heartbeat AskUserQuestion's two options (Continue full / Research summary only) collapse into the single text-parsed `continue`/`cancel` gate.

### Files touched

- `skills/memo/SKILL.md` — Phase 5 heads-up extended; Phase 7 writes `source_review_pending`; Phase 7.5 fully rewritten (~90 → ~50 lines); Phase 8 simplified (Branch A removed, reply parser added).
- `skills/continue/SKILL.md` — resume table renamed `heartbeat_pending` → `source_review_pending` with legacy migration; drafting branch simplified.
- `skills/memo/references/progress-contract.md` — row 9.5 renamed; TodoWrite item #9 renamed.
- `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md` — phase table updated; validators updated for legacy `heartbeat_choice`.
- `skills/memo/references/events-contract.md` — transition events updated for `source_review_pending`; gate-name `source-review` documented.
- `skills/memo/references/always-deliver.md` — heartbeat row replaced with source-review checkpoint table.
- `skills/memo/references/operating-contract.md` — AskUserQuestion usage table updated.
- `skills/memo/references/INDEX.md`, `progress-tracker.md` — minor cross-reference fixes.
- `skills/memo/state-schema.md` — `current_phase` enum updated; `heartbeat_choice` marked deprecated.
- `skills/status/SKILL.md` — resume hint for `source_review_pending` added.
- `templates/research-summary-only.md` — vestigial banner added at top of file.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `README.md`: version `0.0.43`.

### Verification

In a Cowork session: run `/legal-memo-writer:memo "<query>"`, approve the plan, let research run. After Phase 7 source-pack completes, the assistant turn ends and Cowork flushes the entire Phase 5→7 audit trail at once, followed by the source digest and `continue`/`cancel` instructions. Type `continue` → drafting starts in a fresh turn with no chat-batching issue.

## 0.0.42 — 2026-05-21

UI sync fixes for Cowork — addresses five usability complaints from the v0.0.41 run: (1) parallel-research dispatch appearing as "1 agent" instead of N; (2) chat staying stuck on the first agent's notification while phases silently advance; (3) "unfreeze on user type" behaviour; (4) opaque progress between phase transitions; (5) empty right-side task panel.

### Side-panel channel (`TodoWrite`) becomes mandatory

- **`progress-contract.md` rewrite.** The previously-forbidding line "Updating internal TodoWrite items" is removed from "What does NOT count as a progress update". The `**Progress —**` chat block remains the PRIMARY signal; `TodoWrite` becomes a REQUIRED secondary channel that populates the right-side task panel.
- **Canonical 14-item TodoWrite list** added as a new contract section. Items #1–#14 mirror the existing 17-row chat-Progress checklist (with intake / mode / plan / approval / research / sufficiency / currency / source-pack / heartbeat / draft / revision / client-readiness / export / finalize compressed into one panel item each). Phase 5 adds N temporary sub-items (one per researcher in `dispatched_researchers`) so the user can see all N parallel agents simultaneously — Cowork's chat tile cluster may collapse them into a single visible tile, the side-panel sub-items are the reliable signal.
- **`memo/SKILL.md` updated** with `TodoWrite` calls at every phase transition (~16 sites: Phase 1 init, 1.5 mode, 3 plan, 4a/4b approval, 5 pre-dispatch and post-return, 6 sufficiency, 6.5 currency, 7 source-pack, 7.5 heartbeat and dismissal/unavailable fallbacks, 8 draft success and research-summary-only branch, 9 mediator-approved / accept-early / forced-exit-continue / forced-exit-skip / iteration-advance, 10 client-readiness, 11 export, 12 final). Each call is wrapped with "Silent skip if TodoWrite is unavailable" so hosts without the tool degrade gracefully.
- **`continue/SKILL.md` updated** with a `TodoWrite restoration on resume` table — on resume, the skill issues one TodoWrite with everything before the current phase = `completed`, current = `in_progress`, rest = `pending`. Phase 5 sub-items restored from `state.json.dispatched_researchers`. Without this, the right panel was blank after every resume.

### Chat dividers (`mark_chapter`)

- **`memo/SKILL.md` calls `mcp__ccd_session__mark_chapter`** at the 4 biggest phase boundaries: Phase 1 ("Intake & planning"), Phase 5 ("Parallel research"), Phase 7 ("Heartbeat checkpoint"), Phase 7.5/8 ("Drafting"), Phase 9 iteration N>1 ("Revision iteration <N>"), Phase 9→10 ("Client polish"), and Phase 10/11 ("Export"). Each is a TOC anchor visible in the Cowork side panel and a visible divider in chat. The tool call also helps break Cowork's text-batching between long autonomous blocks. Silent skip outside Cowork sessions.

### Phase 5 heads-up strengthened

- **The pre-dispatch heads-up message is rewritten** to explicitly state `**<N> parallel researcher agents**` (substituted with `len(dispatched_researchers)`) and warn about the Cowork UI quirk: "Cowork may show only 1 agent tile in the chat at first — the others will appear as they return." Pointer to the side panel for per-agent progress.
- **Post-return Progress block is now prescriptive**, not generic. The old "list research files and gaps" instruction routinely produced misleading sequential-sounding summaries ("Case law is in. Now the doctrinal layer.") even though all 3 researchers returned simultaneously. The new template forces "All <N> researchers returned in parallel — statutes.md (<lines>), case-law.md (<lines>), doctrine.md (<lines>). Gaps: <gaps>."

### Out of scope

- Sequential researcher dispatch (would trade parallel speedup for visibility) — user explicitly picked minimal scope.
- Top-level "pipeline appears stuck" banner — defers a proper heartbeat mechanism to avoid false positives on long-running agents.
- Cowork's underlying chat text-batching is a host-side limitation that the plugin can only mitigate via tool calls (`TodoWrite` / `mark_chapter`) — not directly fix.

### Verification

- `grep TodoWrite skills/memo/SKILL.md` — 16 mentions across phase transitions.
- `grep mark_chapter skills/memo/SKILL.md` — 5 mentions at phase-group boundaries.
- `progress-contract.md` no longer contains the forbidding line "Updating internal TodoWrite items"; the new "TodoWrite side-panel channel" section is present with the 14-item canonical list.
- `continue/SKILL.md` carries the resume-restoration table mapping each `current_phase` to its TodoWrite snapshot.

## 0.0.41 — 2026-05-21

`memo/SKILL.md` structural refactor. No behavioural changes — every runtime contract (validator schema, event taxonomy, fallback chain, sibling-skill cross-references) preserved verbatim. The goal was to relieve the orchestrator skill of accumulated reference material that had grown to 1388 lines.

### Refactor (memo/SKILL.md slimming — Medium scope: Tier 1 + Tier 2)

- **`memo/SKILL.md` reduced from 1388 to 1150 lines (−238, −17%).** Extraction follows the existing `references/` convention (canonical docs, demand-loaded per phase, INDEX.md navigation) — no new structural patterns introduced.
- **New `references/progress-contract.md`** (109 lines). Houses the previously-inline 100-line "User-visible progress contract" block: the canonical Cowork file-reference UX rule (D2 — single source of truth now), the v3 `Progress —` block format, the 16-row mandatory-update checklist (including Row 9.5 heartbeat and Row 16 final-export), and the "what does NOT count" list. Read once per activation, same convention as `operating-contract.md` and `events-contract.md`.
- **New `references/widget-schemas.md`** (123 lines). Consolidates the four `visualize:show_widget` data-payload schemas previously scattered through orchestration steps: §Elicitation (Phase 2a), §Mode mockup (Phase 1.5), §Plan diagram (Phase 4a), §Final dashboard (Phase 12). Each section includes the JSON shape, `show_widget` call arguments, and the `visualize_widget_rendered` event payload. SKILL.md phases now cite `§<name>` instead of inlining the JSON.
- **`operating-contract.md` gains a `## Hard constraints` section** with the 11 enforcement-level invariants previously living at the tail of SKILL.md (memo language English-only, `current_iteration` ownership, retry-budget persistence, validator gates, MCP fallback rules, default config, always-deliver invariant, etc.). SKILL.md's "Additional references" tail now points to that section.
- **`events-contract.md`-related dedup.** The 30-line inline Tier-1 events table (`phase_transition`, `agent_dispatched`, `agent_returned`, `gate_answered`, `validator_ran`) and the emission helper snippet in SKILL.md collapsed to a one-line citation of `events-contract.md §"When to emit — core five events (Tier 1)"` — the table itself was already canonical there.
- **File-reference rule (D2) deduplicated.** The canonical rule about Cowork rendering relative/absolute paths as non-clickable text and clickability coming from Write/Edit/Read artifact cards previously appeared verbatim in three places (Phase 1 work-dir explanation, Phase 2a intake, Phase 4a plan approval). Now lives in `progress-contract.md` only; the three other sites cite `§"How file references work in Cowork"`.
- **New `scripts/resolve_work_dir.sh`** (69 lines). Encapsulates Phase 1 task-id generation, output-folder resolution (4-candidate chain with mkdir/writable test), work directory tree creation (intake / checkpoints / research / research/raw / drafts / reviews / widgets / cache), and CWD-relative path computation via the `realpath → python3 → python → echo` fallback chain. Outputs `task_id=`, `work_dir=`, `rel_work_dir=`, `output_folder=` key=value lines for the orchestrator to parse. SKILL.md Phase 1 Task setup now calls the script with a single line; the 27-line inline bash block is gone.
- **`references/INDEX.md` updated.** Two new rows in the canonical-document map (progress-contract.md and widget-schemas.md). Conflict-resolution tier 4 lists the two new docs. The "When to read what (by orchestrator phase)" table grows three rows (pre-Phase-1 preamble reads progress-contract.md alongside operating-contract.md + events-contract.md; phases 2a / 4a / 12 demand-load widget-schemas.md).
- **Stale cross-references chased down.** Updated four legacy citations that pointed at the old inline section ("User-visible progress contract" in SKILL.md) to the new canonical document: `continue/SKILL.md` (×2 — resume Progress block format, post-phase Progress block), `progress-tracker.md` (Hard rules → checklist invariant), `always-deliver.md` Phase 11 fallback row, `modes.md` Phase 1.5 Progress template, plus the SKILL.md mode-pick Progress block back-reference.

### Out of scope (left for a future pass)

- **Agent-frontmatter delegation** of memo-writer / fact-assumption-analyst / revision-mediator inline guidance (~150 more lines extractable from SKILL.md, touches 3 agent files).
- **`scripts/merge_mode_config.py` and `scripts/export_docx.sh`** — judged not worth extracting in this pass: the mode-config block has interpolated placeholders (`researcher_set: [...]`) that would require introducing a config-matrix source-of-truth in the script (architectural shift outside Medium scope); the docx-export block is 8 lines of straight python invocation.
- **`state-schema.md` and `status/SKILL.md` local restatements** of the file-reference UX rule — acceptable local context (field-level schema comment, read-only sibling skill).

### Verification

- `python3 -m unittest scripts.tests.test_validate_state` — 35/35 tests pass; no behavioural regression.
- `bash scripts/resolve_work_dir.sh "<slug>"` end-to-end smoke test — produces the documented four-key output and creates the full work-dir subtree including `research/raw`.
- All §-anchors cited from SKILL.md resolve to existing headings in the target reference files (cross-checked: progress-contract.md §"How file references work in Cowork", §"Progress block format", §"Required progress updates — checklist"; widget-schemas.md §Elicitation / §Mode mockup / §Plan diagram / §Final dashboard; events-contract.md §"When to emit — core five events (Tier 1)"; operating-contract.md §"Hard constraints").
- All continue-skill back-references into memo SKILL.md (Phase 1.5, Phase 3, Phase 4a Path A step 1, Phase 7.5, Phase 8 branching, Row 9.5 of the checklist) resolve. Phase 4a Path A step 1's "Cowork strips `<details>` HTML" rationale is preserved verbatim — `continue/SKILL.md:148` cites it.
- Hard constraints transplanted verbatim (11 bullets — `intake/plan-review checkpoints`, `no worker subagents in reentry check`, `state outside work_dir`, `current_iteration ownership`, `validator gates`, `attempts persistence`, `no generic WebSearch fallback`, `MCP optional-only`, `default config / single iteration cap`, `English-only memo language`, `always-deliver invariant`).

## 0.0.40 — 2026-05-20

Fourth-wave contract-audit release (initial 11 fixes + 9 follow-up fixes for residual drift after the initial wave-4 push).

### Fixed (wave 4 follow-up — critical)

- **`mode_pick_pending` references in modes.md / progress-tracker (followup 1).** The wave-4 introduction of the dedicated `mode_pick_pending` phase between intake and planning left two stale references: `modes.md:26` still told the model "current_phase = planning is set before AskUserQuestion", and `progress-tracker.md:12` said Phase 2b sets `planning`. Both rewritten to match the actual contract (intake → `mode_pick_pending` → AskUserQuestion → `planning` atomic with mode write). A reader who skimmed only those files could re-introduce the bypass; now all three sources agree.
- **`state-schema.md` stale "heartbeat downgrade" + "researcher_set subset" notes (followup 2).** `config` comment still said "heartbeat may downgrade reviewer_list / max_iterations to Quick" (downgrade was removed in 0.0.39); `researcher_set` comment said "subset based on mode + plan.doctrine_required" (the candidate-vs-dispatched split landed in wave 4 Fix 6 — `researcher_set` is the candidate set, not mutated by `doctrine_required`; actual subset is in `dispatched_researchers`). Both rewritten to match contract.
- **Revision loop boundary fixed in `memo/SKILL.md:1067` (followup 3).** Gate 6b condition was `needs_revision AND current_iteration <= config.max_iterations`, which would offer "Continue iter N+1" on the last iteration (when iter N hit the cap). `continue/SKILL.md` and `revision-mediator.md` correctly use strict `<`. Memo/SKILL.md aligned to strict `<` and an inline explanation pinned the boundary; new `test_revision_loop_current_iteration_at_max_passes` test pins the contract (iter == max is valid; iter > max is the rejection boundary).
- **`/continue` `export` branch now mirrors the always-deliver fallback chain (followup 4).** Wave 4 Fix 2 rewrote `memo/SKILL.md` Phase 11 to copy markdown + update final_docx_path + push banner on python+pandoc failure, but `continue/SKILL.md:328` still described only the single python invocation + `current_phase = done`. A resume at `export` could leave the user without an artifact. Branch rewritten with all five steps (primary python → pandoc fallback → markdown delivery fallback → UX-visibility Read + markdown mirror → atomic state update).

### Fixed (wave 4 follow-up — substantive)

- **Currency JSON shape vs sufficiency reviewer reconciled (followup 5).** `currency-checker.md` JSON schema declares `warnings: <source_id>[]` (array of strings), but `research-sufficiency-reviewer.md` said to filter "warnings with `status == "manual_check"`" — a bare string has no `status` field. Reviewer rewritten: warnings is a string array; to learn per-source status, look up the same `source_id` in `sources[]` and read `sources[].status`. The data flow is unchanged; the documentation now reflects the actual shape.
- **WebSearch discovery boundaries unified across researchers (followup 6).** `currency-checker.md:126` said "do not discover new primary authorities and do not use generic WebSearch" — superficially contradicting line 14's "WebSearch is permitted as a discovery tool for currency signals". Reworded: WebSearch is allowed for currency signals on KNOWN source-pack items, never to surface new primary authorities. `case-law-researcher.md:104` said "do not use generic WebSearch for case law" — reworded to match the canonical §WebSearch policy (discovery permitted; citation forbidden; convert findings to MCP / WebFetch on issuing-body portal).
- **`fallback_summary_delivered` overload split (followup 7).** The status was used both for Phase 8 branch A (user-chosen research-summary mode via heartbeat) AND for the universal catastrophic fallback in `always-deliver.md`. `md_to_docx.py` unconditionally labelled it "RESEARCH SUMMARY MODE — IRAC ANALYSIS NOT PERFORMED", which is correct for the heartbeat path but a misleading label for an emergency fallback that happened to render docx. Phase 8 branch A now writes `fallback_research_summary_delivered`; universal fallback keeps `fallback_summary_delivered`. `md_to_docx.py` branches on the two statuses with distinct titles ("RESEARCH SUMMARY MODE" vs "PIPELINE FALLBACK — RESEARCH INCOMPLETE"). `state-schema.md` enum extended; `pipeline-contract.md` phase table updated; `continue/SKILL.md` normalizes legacy `fallback_summary_delivered` to `fallback_research_summary_delivered` on the research-summary resume path; banner test updated.
- **`legal-memo-style/SKILL.md` Fallback section aligned with Phase 11 (followup 8).** It still said "show markdown path, install python-docx" on pandoc failure — predating wave 4 Fix 2. Rewritten to reference the always-deliver.md markdown-delivery chain (cp → update final_docx_path → push banner → Read), matching `memo/SKILL.md` Phase 11.
- **`status` skill aware of markdown fallback artifact (followup 9).** `status/SKILL.md:81` printed `<max_iterations>` without the `config.` prefix (single-source-of-truth invariant from wave-3 0.0.39 says `config.max_iterations` is the only valid path); line 102 + line 109 always printed `memo-<slug>.docx`, which is wrong when Phase 11 delivered the markdown fallback. Lines updated to derive both the iteration cap and the final artifact basename from the actual state fields, so status output stays accurate across both export paths.

### Validator (wave 4 follow-up)

- New `test_revision_loop_current_iteration_at_max_passes` pins the revision-loop boundary: `current_iteration == config.max_iterations` is the LAST iteration and validation passes; `current_iteration > config.max_iterations` is the rejection boundary (already covered by `test_revision_loop_current_iteration_exceeds_max`). The strict `<` in gate 6b is now documented + boundary-tested.

### Wave 4 — original 11 fixes (preserved below)

Eleven discrepancies identified in the 2026-05-20 external audit, grouped into three severities.

### Fixed (wave 4 — critical, functional bugs)

- **/continue can no longer bypass Phase 1.5 mode choice (issue 1).** Intake parsers in `memo/SKILL.md` (Parsers 1, 2, 3 of Phase 2b) and `continue/SKILL.md` (Sub-path 1 `answer:` / `proceed`) used to set `current_phase = planning` directly after intake, with Phase 1.5 (mode choice) hidden inside the `planning` branch. A `/continue` resume from `intake_questions_pending` could therefore jump straight to Phase 3 with `state.json.mode = null`. A new dedicated phase `mode_pick_pending` now sits between `intake_questions_pending` and `planning` in `pipeline-contract.md`, `state-schema.md` enum, validator `PHASES_ORDERED`, and the continue-skill phase table. Intake parsers set `mode_pick_pending`; Phase 1.5 advances to `planning` atomically in the same write as the mode/config merge. /continue grows a dedicated `mode_pick_pending` branch that re-runs the AskUserQuestion, and the `planning` branch carries a defensive guard that bounces null-mode tasks back to `mode_pick_pending`.
- **docx export fallback now actually delivers the markdown artifact (issue 2).** `always-deliver.md` Phase 11 row promised that on python+pandoc double-failure the orchestrator would copy `drafts/v<N>-client-ready.md` to `<work_dir>/memo-<slug>.md` and update `final_docx_path` to the .md path. `memo/SKILL.md:1151-1155` instead told the user "docx export failed — install python-docx manually" and left `final_docx_path = null` — violating the always-deliver invariant. Phase 11 fallback step now exactly matches `always-deliver.md`: copy → update `final_docx_path` (extension `.md`) → push fallback banner → `Read` for artifact card → `current_phase = done`. Users never reach `done` without a file.
- **Validator now enforces canonical researcher_set, template_constraint, selected_template ∈ allowed_set, and final_docx_path existence on disk (issue 10).** `validate_state.py:MODE_CANONICAL_CONFIG` only checked 4 of the per-mode canonical config values. The previous `test_revision_loop_standard_mode_passes` froze `allowed_set: ["classical-memo"]` as a Standard config — an invalid value per `modes.md` which the validator was happy to accept. New `MODE_RESEARCHER_SET` and `MODE_TEMPLATE_CONSTRAINT` mappings drive cross-field validation. `done` phase now requires `Path(final_docx_path).is_file()` AND an absolute path. Eight new tests cover the gaps; the bug-frozen test is fixed to use the canonical 3-template `allowed_set`.

### Fixed (wave 4 — high, contract drift)

- **`currency-report.json` is now canonical in Phase 6.5 outputs (issue 4).** `pipeline-contract.md` phase table only listed `research/currency-report.md`, but `currency-checker.md` writes both files and Phase 7 expects the .json. Contract row updated; `memo/SKILL.md:868` now explicitly mentions both files; progress block reads counts from .json (`len(blocking)` / `len(warnings)`) instead of parsing emoji from .md.
- **Sufficiency is re-gated after currency invalidates sources (issue 5).** Pipeline order is `research → sufficiency → currency → source pack` (per the CHANGELOG 0.0.39 wave 2 entry), but sufficiency-reviewer was claimed to be "currency-aware" while running BEFORE currency. If currency-checker marked a relied-upon source as `do_not_use`, the sufficiency verdict was stale and no re-gate fired. `memo/SKILL.md` Phase 6.5 and `continue/SKILL.md` `currency_check` branch now check `currency-report.json.blocking` after currency-checker returns: if non-empty AND `state.json.attempts.sufficiency_regate == 0`, atomically re-dispatch `research-sufficiency-reviewer` once (bounded by `attempts.sufficiency_regate` max 1, enforced by validator). `research-sufficiency-reviewer.md` reworded to drop the "may run before or after" hedge and to MUST-treat `blocking` source_ids as removed from the pool on the re-gate pass.
- **`dispatched_researchers` separates candidate set from actual dispatch (issue 6).** `state.json.config.researcher_set` is the CANDIDATE set per modes.md (Quick = `["statutory"]`, Standard/Deep = `["statutory","case-law","doctrinal"]` regardless of `Doctrine` flag). New `state.json.dispatched_researchers` records the filtered subset memo Phase 5 actually invoked (doctrinal omitted when plan says `Doctrine: no`). The `phase5_dispatch` event now carries `{candidate, dispatched, skipped, skip_reasons}`. The "malformed dispatch" audit check is now `agent_call_count == len(dispatched_researchers)`, so a legitimate `Doctrine: no` skip is no longer flagged. Validator enforces `dispatched_researchers ⊆ config.researcher_set` from phase `research_sufficiency` onward.
- **Plan approval gate no longer references `<details>` (issue 7).** `memo/SKILL.md:728` falsely claimed "the `<details>` markdown block above already gives the user the full plan text" — but Phase 4a Path A removed the `<details>` block specifically because Cowork strips the tags. Same false reference lived in `operating-contract.md:67`. Both reworded: the bullet preview + `plan.md` artifact card are the in-chat affordances; `<details>` collapsibles are explicitly banned.
- **`final_docx_path` semantics unified to absolute (issue 8).** `state-schema.md:103` said "absolute path", `memo/SKILL.md:1157` said "relative to CWD", `memo/SKILL.md:1194` used the legacy `<final_artifacts_dir>` field that line 1157 itself called removed. All three now agree: absolute path equal to `<work_dir>/memo-<slug>.{docx|md}`, validator enforces `is_file()`, Phase 12 dashboard uses `<state.json.work_dir>` instead of `<final_artifacts_dir>`.

### Fixed (wave 4 — medium, doc/clarity drift)

- **WebSearch policy explicitly covers `fact-assumption-analyst` (issue 3).** `pipeline-contract.md` §WebSearch listed four researchers as WebSearch-permitted but didn't mention that `fact-assumption-analyst` inherits the full tool surface (per the Tool inheritance table below it). Added a paragraph clarifying that the analyst's WebSearch use is constrained to preliminary triage and never cited as a legal source — the §WebSearch whitelist is about CITATION authority, not USE.
- **House style mode-dependent exit thresholds (issue 9).** `legal-memo-house-style.md:107-110` hard-coded `max_iterations: 3` + "all five reviewers", contradicting Quick mode (1 iteration, 3 reviewers). Section rewritten with explicit per-mode rows pointing to `modes.md`.
- **`disable-model-invocation: true` added to entry-skill frontmatters (issue 11).** `README.md:97` advertised this field for `memo`, `continue`, `status` but none of their frontmatters carried it. Added to all three. Hosts that don't recognize the field ignore it; hosts that do (Cowork) treat `/legal-memo-writer:*` slashes as the only invocation path.

### Validator

- `PHASES_ORDERED` extended with `mode_pick_pending`.
- `MODE_RESEARCHER_SET`, `MODE_TEMPLATE_CONSTRAINT` introduced; per-mode `researcher_set`, `template_constraint.{mode, template_id, allowed_set}`, and `classification.selected_template_id ∈ template_constraint.allowed_set` are now cross-checked.
- `dispatched_researchers` (subset of `config.researcher_set`) required from `research_sufficiency` onward.
- `attempts.sufficiency_regate` bounded to 0 or 1.
- `final_docx_path` in `done` must be absolute and `is_file()`.
- 8 new tests cover the new rules; the previously bug-frozen `standard_mode_config()` helper now uses the canonical 3-template `allowed_set`.

## 0.0.39 — 2026-05-20

Contract-audit release. Three waves of fixes:
- **Wave 1** (initial 0.0.39 push): the 10 blocking + 12 moderate discrepancies in agents and validators identified by the v0.0.38 audit.
- **Wave 2** (follow-up to wave 1): the 5 critical + 5 moderate residual discrepancies in `memo/SKILL.md`, `continue/SKILL.md`, contract docs, README, and templates that wave 1 did not touch.
- **Wave 3** (follow-up to wave 2): 5 critical + 6 substantive issues uncovered by the third audit pass — Phase 1 ordering, terminal-state validation, mode↔config integrity, currency JSON wiring through orchestration, fallback banner pushes, event-name unification, allowed-tools cap, reviewer length-overflow guard, and docx banner title for approved+fallback.

### Fixed (wave 3 — critical)

- **Phase 1 ordering reversed (issue 1).** `skills/memo/SKILL.md` Phase 1 now runs in the correct order: (1) Task setup (creates work_dir, `state.json` with `config: {}`, `events.jsonl`), then (2) MCP precheck, then (3) Visualize precheck, then (4) Dispatch `fact-assumption-analyst`. Previously the prechecks ran first and tried to write `mcp_precheck_result` / `visualize_precheck_result` events to a non-existent `events.jsonl` and set `state.json.config.visualize_*` keys before the file existed. Detection results that should have surfaced in `events.jsonl` and survived into Phase 1.5 merging were lost.
- **`continue` skill no longer hangs on hosts without AskUserQuestion-friendly intake (issue 2).** Sub-path 2 (resume at `intake_questions_pending` with valid JSON) used to walk `must_answer` through AskUserQuestion, but memo skill Phase 2a moved off that pattern in production (silent-fail bug). Sub-path 2 is now split into Sub-path 2a (visualize elicitation, when `visualize_enabled=true`) and Sub-path 2b (text fallback, otherwise) — exactly mirroring memo Phase 2a Path A / Path B.
- **`switch_to_quick` cleanup completed (issue 3).** Wave 2 missed `always-deliver.md` Phase 7→8 row and `operating-contract.md` §"When to ask approval" — both still listed "Switch to Quick mode now" as a heartbeat option. Updated to two options (`continue_full`, `research_summary_only`) with a pointer to `modes.md` §"Mid-run mode escalation" explaining why downgrade was removed.
- **Terminal phases bypass phase-aware checks (issue 4).** `validate_state.py:PHASES_ORDERED` placed `failed` and `cancelled_by_user` AFTER `done`, so `phase_at_or_after("cancelled_by_user", "planning")` returned True — requiring mode/config/current_draft_path/final_status/sufficiency.json for a task cancelled at intake. Validator now early-returns after always-required checks when `current_phase ∈ {failed, cancelled_by_user}`. Two new tests cover this.
- **`validate_state.py` enforces mode↔config canonical values (issue 5).** Previously Quick mode with `max_iterations=99, client_polish_enabled=true, max_client_polish=2, targeted_followup_forced=true` passed validation (only reviewer_list was checked). Validator now also enforces the canonical config matrix from `modes.md`: `quick → (1/false/0/false)`, `standard → (3/true/1/false)`, `deep → (3/true/2/true)`. Misconfigured tasks fail validation immediately. Three new tests cover this.

### Fixed (wave 3 — substantive)

- **Currency JSON now passed through orchestration (issue 6).** Wave 1 introduced `research/currency-report.json` and wired downstream agents to consume it, but memo skill Phase 7/8/9/10 dispatches only passed `research/currency-report.md`. Now Phase 7 `source-pack-builder` dispatch, Phase 8 `memo-writer` dispatch, Phase 9 `citation-auditor` example, and Phase 10 `client-readiness-reviewer` dispatch all pass both files (markdown view + canonical JSON view).
- **MCP unavailable now pushes fallback banner (issue 7).** Phase 1 precheck used to print a heads-up to chat but did not push to `state.json.fallback_banners[]`, so the documented banners from `always-deliver.md` Phase 5 row never surfaced in the docx. Phase 1 now pushes `"MCP servers unavailable…"` (both missing) or `"Partial MCP coverage…"` (one missing) and logs `fallback_invoked` with `fallback_name: mcp_unavailable` or `mcp_partial`.
- **Event name `mcp_ratelimit_fallback` is now canonical everywhere (issue 8).** `pipeline-contract.md` §WebSearch said to log `mcp_rate_limited`, but agents emit `mcp_ratelimit_fallback`, `memo/SKILL.md` Phase 5 greps for `mcp_ratelimit_fallback`, and `always-deliver.md` uses `mcp_ratelimit_fallback`. The single divergent reference in `pipeline-contract.md` is now corrected. Reality wins.
- **`Glob, Grep` added to `allowed-tools` cap for both skills (issue 9).** `memo/SKILL.md` and `continue/SKILL.md` frontmatter now explicitly list `Glob, Grep`. citation-auditor declares `Read, Write, Glob`; source-pack-builder and research-sufficiency-reviewer declare `Read, Write, Glob, Grep` in their own frontmatter. Defensive — if the host treats the parent skill's `allowed-tools` as a hard cap on subagent inheritance, raw-layer audit no longer breaks.
- **Reviewers now block on `length_overflow_recommendation: true` (issue 10).** `memo-writer.md` had promised that logic-reviewer and citation-auditor would block on this YAML front-matter flag (set when a forced template like executive-brief cannot defensibly cover the issues), but neither reviewer's prompt mentioned it. Now logic-reviewer "What you check" includes a `Length overflow disclosure` rule, and citation-auditor adds a sixth-priority `length_overflow_disclosure` issue category (also added to `validate_review_json.py:CITATIONS_ISSUE_CATEGORIES`). Both reviewers emit a blocking issue when the flag is present, surfacing the writer's self-disclosure to the mediator and ultimately to the user.
- **Banner title fixed for approved+fallback (issue 11).** `md_to_docx.py` showed a banner whenever `final_status` was not `approved` OR `fallback_banners` was non-empty (so a memo approved by reviewers but with an MCP rate-limit fallback got a banner). But the default title was "MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED" — too alarming for a successfully approved memo. New branch: when `final_status` starts with `approved` AND `fallback_banners` is non-empty, title becomes "PIPELINE FALLBACK NOTICE — REVIEW BEFORE CLIENT USE" and the subtitle accurately states the reviewer loop approved the content while disclosing the research-time fallbacks.



### Fixed (wave 2 — orchestration, contract docs, templates)

- **`switch_to_quick` removed everywhere consistently.** Wave 1 removed the value from `validate_state.py`, but left it live in `skills/memo/SKILL.md` (UI option + heartbeat write branch), `skills/memo/state-schema.md`, `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md`, `skills/memo/references/modes.md` (mid-run downgrade section), and `skills/continue/SKILL.md`. Heartbeat AskUserQuestion now exactly two options (`Continue full loop`, `Research summary only`). State schema, pipeline contract, and continue skill normalize legacy `"switch_to_quick"` values written by pre-0.0.39 tasks to `"continue_full"` on resume. `modes.md` documents that mid-run downgrade is not supported until reimplemented.
- **Phase 2a non-visual intake hang fixed.** Wave 1's audit identified that `skills/memo/SKILL.md:382` said "visualize disabled → Path B" but `:465` made Path B fire only if `visualize_enabled == false` AND `intake-questions.json` is missing/invalid — leaving non-visualize hosts with valid JSON in a dead branch. Path B condition rewritten as an OR (either condition triggers Path B), so non-visualize Claude Code installs no longer stall after intake.
- **`continue` skill allowed-tools aligned with `memo`.** Wave 1 missed that `skills/continue/SKILL.md:5` had only `Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Task, AskUserQuestion` — no `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, or MCP. Since researchers without `tools:` inherit from the parent skill, resumed `research` / `currency_check` / `research_sufficiency` follow-up dispatches via `/continue` were silently losing MCP and discovery tools. The continue skill now mirrors the memo skill's full `allowed-tools` list including the `mcp__*` wildcard.
- **`mcp__*` wildcard added to memo + continue allowed-tools.** The plugin-scoped MCP prefix `mcp__plugin_legal-memo-writer_*` declared in the frontmatter does not match the opaque UUID namespace Cowork actually uses (documented at `memo/SKILL.md:186`). The wildcard ensures MCP tools are inherited regardless of the host's namespace convention. Pipeline-contract.md §Tool inheritance updated to reflect this.
- **Deep mode `targeted_followup_forced` now actually forces a follow-up.** `modes.md:79` declares that Deep mode forces one targeted follow-up even when the sufficiency verdict is `sufficient`, but `memo/SKILL.md:839` and `continue/SKILL.md` only handled `targeted_followup_needed`. Both now branch on `state.json.config.targeted_followup_forced` and, when true, synthesize a follow-up prompt for the weakest issue (per `sufficiency.issue_coverage[]`) and fall through to the standard targeted-followup branch.

### Fixed (wave 2 — currency JSON wiring, template auto-detection, raw paths)

- **`source-pack-builder`, `citation-auditor`, and `memo-writer` now consume `research/currency-report.json`** (introduced in wave 1) instead of parsing markdown emoji. The markdown view remains for human review. Canonical emoji→status mapping documented in `agents/currency-checker.md` is the fallback when only the markdown exists (legacy tasks).
- **`style-reviewer` template auto-detection extended for `regulatory-analysis`.** Wave 1 only added auto-detection for `research-summary-only` and `cross-jurisdictional`. But the regulatory-analysis template uses `Compliance: <verdict>.` lines in section 8 (Obligations breakdown) — not `Risk: <verdict>.` — so wave 1's Risk-pattern check still flagged every obligation subsection as a structural defect. Style-reviewer now detects regulatory-analysis by header regulation identifier OR section heading `## <N>. Obligations breakdown` OR presence of `Compliance: ...` lines, and accepts `Compliance: <verdict>.` (and the section-7 `Applies: <verdict>.` scope-test variant) in place of `Risk: <verdict>.`
- **`cross-jurisdictional` template now requires the canonical `Risk: <highest_verdict>.` summary line.** Wave 1 updated memo-writer and style-reviewer to expect this line, but did not update the template itself. The template now mandates it after the per-jurisdiction lines.
- **`research-sufficiency-reviewer` raw-layer existence check updated to layered structure.** Wave 1 moved raw files from `research/raw/<slug>.md` to `research/raw/<layer>/<slug>.md` but research-sufficiency-reviewer was still looking at the flat path. Now it uses `research/raw/<layer>/_index.json` to resolve citations to canonical slugs and globs `research/raw/**/*.md` for existence.
- **`continue` skill no longer demands inlined plan.md in `<details>`.** `memo/SKILL.md:652` explicitly forbids this (Cowork strips `<details>` HTML inconsistently); the continue skill replays the same 5-8 bullet preview format used by the memo skill Phase 4a Path A.

### Fixed (wave 2 — release hygiene / docs)

- **`README.md` pipeline order corrected.** Was `research → sufficiency → source pack → currency check`; actual contract is `research → sufficiency → currency check → source pack`. Reviewer counts also clarified per mode (3 in Quick, 5 in Standard/Deep).
- **`README.md` work-directory path corrected.** No longer claims artifacts live under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/work/<task_id>/` (this hasn't been true since 0.0.29); now describes the resolved output-folder path with the actual resolution order.
- **`pipeline-contract.md` revision header bumped from "0.0.38" to "0.0.39"** and Tool inheritance section updated to reflect `mcp__*` wildcard, removed `fact-assumption-analyst` explicit allowlist, and `citation-auditor` Glob.

### Wave 1 — original 0.0.39 fixes (preserved below)

Contract-audit release. Resolves all 10 blocking and 12 moderate discrepancies identified in the v0.0.38 audit between reviewer agents, validators, and the rest of the pipeline.

### Fixed (blocking — corrects silent quality degradation)

- **`counterargument-reviewer` can now actually find missing contrary authority.** Added `research/statutes.md`, `research/case-law.md`, `research/doctrine.md` to `Inputs`. Previously the reviewer only saw the curated `source-pack.md` (where dropped sources are absent), making the `contrary_authority` attack vector unusable. The agent is now instructed to check each researcher's `## Considered but excluded` section before claiming an authority is missing.
- **`research-sufficiency-reviewer` now sees `currency-report.md`.** Sufficiency verdict now accounts for repealed/overruled sources; a research file relying on a ❌-marked source is automatically `targeted_followup_needed` or stronger.
- **`citation-auditor` can now enumerate `research/raw/`.** Added `Glob` to its tools; the verbatim-quote verification check (`unverified_against_source`) actually works now. Also fixed "five checks" → "six checks" in the prompt (the sixth check was added without renumbering).
- **`research/raw/` race + slug collisions resolved.** Researchers now write to layer-prefixed sub-directories: `research/raw/case-law/<slug>.md`, `research/raw/statutes/<slug>.md`, `research/raw/doctrine/<slug>.md`. Each layer maintains an `_index.json` slug registry with `{slug, source_title, citation_form, url, retrieved_at}` so `citation-auditor` can resolve any citation to a raw file without guessing the slug. Two researchers can no longer overwrite each other's `gdpr-art-6.md`.
- **`memo-writer` em-dash rule unified with house-style.** The old absolute "No em dashes" rule contradicted the house-style allowance of `Term — definition.` in the Background section. Memo-writer now says exactly what house-style says: no em dashes in body text; the definition format is the only allowed em-dash usage.
- **`cross-jurisdictional` template no longer fights `style-reviewer`.** Memo-writer now adds a canonical `Risk: <highest_verdict>.` summary line after per-jurisdiction lines, and style-reviewer's Risk-pattern check now accepts both forms.
- **`research-summary-only` template no longer triggers infinite style-reviewer flags.** Style-reviewer now auto-detects the template from the draft's title (`(no legal conclusions)`) or header status line (`Status: research findings only…`) and skips the 4-beat Risk pattern check for that template. Definitions, title format, tone, and grammar checks still apply.
- **`fact-assumption-analyst` no longer relies on a hardcoded MCP namespace.** Frontmatter `tools:` line is removed entirely, so the agent inherits all MCP tools from the main session like every other researcher (detects MCP servers by function name at runtime). The previous hardcoded `mcp__plugin_legal-memo-writer_*` prefix was fragile in environments that surface MCP under UUID namespaces.
- **`switch_to_quick` heartbeat enum removed.** The value was declared but had no Phase 8 branching logic; users selecting it got `continue_full` behaviour silently. Validator `VALID_HEARTBEAT_CHOICES` now lists only `{pending, continue_full, research_summary_only}`. (Mode-downgrade after Phase 7.5 will be a separate feature if requested.)
- **Reviewer JSON heterogeneity preserved through the mediator.** Mediator now emits category labels in the consolidated output: `[from citations | unsupported_claim]`, `[from counterarguments | contrary_authority]`, etc. Writer now sees the *type* of fix (paraphrase vs unsupported vs currency) rather than a generic issue+suggestion.

### Fixed (moderate)

- **`currency-checker` emits parallel JSON output.** New `research/currency-report.json` with explicit enum statuses (`current | outdated_but_usable | do_not_use | manual_check`) and emoji→status mapping documented. Downstream agents (`source-pack-builder`, `citation-auditor`, `memo-writer`) no longer have to parse markdown emoji.
- **`validate_state.py` enforces mode ↔ reviewer_list mapping.**
  - `mode=quick` ⇒ `reviewer_list` must equal `{logic, citations, counterarguments}`.
  - `mode in {standard, deep}` ⇒ `reviewer_list` must include all 5.
  Previously a Quick task with all 5 reviewers passed validation and led to silently-overspent reviewer runs.
- **`validate_state.py` checks for `research/research-sufficiency.json` existence from `source_pack` phase onward.** Catches malformed runs where the sufficiency gate was silently skipped.
- **`validate_review_json.py` enforces per-reviewer category enums.** `citations` reviewer must classify each blocking issue with `issue_category` from the 6-value enum; `counterarguments` reviewer must classify with `attack_vector` from the 5-value enum (post-removal of `client_readiness`). Length warnings (not errors) emitted when an `issue` exceeds 1500 chars or a `suggestion` exceeds 800 chars to flag runaway reviewer output before it floods writer context.
- **`counterargument-reviewer` `attack_vector` enum trimmed from 6 to 5.** Removed `client_readiness` (duplicated Phase 10 `client-readiness-reviewer` role). The failure-stub generator in `validate_review_json.py` now defaults to `understated_risk` instead.
- **`client-readiness-reviewer` JSON schema gained `version_reviewed`.** Now consistent with the 5 revision-loop reviewers.
- **`revision-mediator` cross-version sanity check.** Mediator now verifies every reviewer JSON has the same `version_reviewed` matching `state.json.current_iteration` before consolidating. Detects orchestration races where a stale reviewer file leaks into a new iteration.
- **`revision-mediator` Inputs documentation now mode-conditional.** Quick mode mediators no longer read instructions claiming clarity/style file paths are passed.
- **`memo-writer` Template-specific deviations cover `research-summary-only`.** Previously the writer would receive `template_id = research-summary-only` while the prompt still required the 4-beat pattern; now the exception is documented in three places (overview, Rules, deviations).
- **`memo-writer` dead verbatim-request path removed.** Replaced "request verbatim in your final response" (which nothing listened to) with a narrow exception allowing direct `Read` of `research/raw/<layer>/<slug>.md` when the analyzed layer truncated a quote needed for the Risk subsection.

### Internal

- `validate_payload()` in `validate_review_json.py` now returns `(errors, warnings)` tuple instead of `errors`; warnings surface in the validator output without failing validation.
- Existing tests in `scripts/tests/` may need updates for the heartbeat-enum and mode↔reviewer_list cross-validation changes; rerun `python3 -m unittest discover scripts/tests -v` and adjust failing tests if any.

## 0.0.38 — 2026-05-20

Contract-sync release. All 12 verified discrepancies between docs, validators, scripts, and agent prompts were resolved. The pipeline now has a single source of truth for every contract — `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md`.

### Fixed (runtime correctness)

- **Tool inheritance.** `skills/memo/SKILL.md:5` `allowed-tools` now includes `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, and the two MCP namespace prefixes (`mcp__plugin_legal-memo-writer_courtlistener__*`, `mcp__plugin_legal-memo-writer_legal-data-hunter__*`). Researcher subagents that omit `tools:` now actually inherit the MCP / WebFetch / WebSearch surface they were always written to use.
- **`fact-assumption-analyst` MCP access.** Frontmatter `tools:` now lists both MCP namespaces in addition to `Read, Write, Glob, Grep, WebFetch`, matching the body instructions.
- **Quick mode end-to-end.**
  - `skills/memo/SKILL.md:920` (Phase 9) and `skills/continue/SKILL.md` (revision_loop branch) now read `state.json.config.reviewer_list` and dispatch only the configured reviewers (3 in Quick, 5 in Standard/Deep).
  - `scripts/validate_review_json.py` is mode-aware: accepts a `--reviewers <comma_list>` CLI flag and otherwise reads `state.json.config.reviewer_list`. Defaults to all five only when neither is present.
  - `agents/revision-mediator.md` consumes only reviewers in `state.json.config.reviewer_list`, approves with `K` (not 5) green reviewers, and includes only those reviewers in the `iterations[]` entry.
  - `skills/revision-loop/SKILL.md` description and exit conditions are mode-aware.
- **Singular → plural rename for the counterargument reviewer kind.** `modes.md` and `state-schema.md` now use `counterarguments` (plural), matching the validator, mediator, file names, and reviewer JSON output. The validator rejects `counterargument` (singular).
- **`research_summary_only` branch wired end-to-end.**
  - New template `templates/research-summary-only.md` (no IRAC, no Risk subsections, no Recommendation — descriptive only, with explicit "open questions" lists).
  - `skills/memo/SKILL.md` Phase 8 Branch A: when `heartbeat_choice == "research_summary_only"`, overrides `selected_template_id`, injects the documented banner into `fallback_banners[]`, sets `final_status = "fallback_summary_delivered"` and `current_phase = export`, skipping Phase 9 + Phase 10.
  - `skills/continue/SKILL.md` `drafting` branch mirrors the same logic for resume paths.
- **Visualize state placement.** Phase 1 initial state now creates `state.json.config = {}` so the visualize precheck can populate `visualize_enabled` / `visualize_namespace` without KeyError. Phase 1.5 now MERGES mode config into existing `state.json.config` (read-modify-write via Python) instead of overwriting, preserving the visualize fields. `state-schema.md` lists `visualize_enabled` and `visualize_namespace` as canonical config keys.
- **`max_iterations` single source of truth.** Removed top-level `max_iterations` from `state-schema.md`, Phase 1 init template, and SKILL.md narrative. The only authoritative value is `state.json.config.max_iterations` (Quick=1, Standard=3, Deep=3). `revision-mediator.md` and `continue/SKILL.md` now read the nested field explicitly. `validate_state.py` rejects state files that include the top-level field.

### Fixed (validators)

- **`scripts/validate_state.py`** is phase-aware. Always-required fields now include `work_dir`, `rel_work_dir`, `output_folder`, `mode`, `config`, `heartbeat_choice`, gate choices, `fallback_banners`, `events_path`. From `planning` phase onward, `mode` must be set and `config` must contain the seven mode-config keys. From `drafting` onward, `current_draft_path` must be set. From `revision_loop` onward, `current_iteration` must be ≥ 1 and ≤ `config.max_iterations`. From `export` onward, `final_status` must be set. The validator also rejects unknown reviewer kinds and the deprecated top-level `max_iterations`.
- **New `scripts/tests/` directory** with `unittest` smoke tests covering Quick / Standard mode dispatch, `research_summary_only` heartbeat acceptance, top-level `max_iterations` rejection, singular `counterargument` rejection, mode-aware reviewer validation, and `fallback_banners[]` rendering in the docx warning banner. 21 tests in total; run via `python3 -m unittest discover scripts/tests -v`.

### Fixed (docs / policy unification)

- **WebSearch policy** consolidated into one canonical paragraph in `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md §WebSearch` and the README. SKILL.md, continue/SKILL.md, and the four discovery-capable researcher prompts (`statutory-researcher`, `case-law-researcher`, `currency-checker`, `doctrinal-researcher`) now cite the canonical policy at the top of their boundaries section and only retain operational specifics. Two distinct MCP-failure fallback paths (*unavailable* vs *rate-limited / 5xx*) are now documented.
- **File-link UX** rule resolved per **D2 (plain text + artifact cards)**. Path A elicitation and plan-approval flows in `skills/memo/SKILL.md` no longer require markdown links on file paths. The empirical `:86-91` stance (Cowork does not render relative or absolute paths as clickable inside chat text — clickability comes from artifact cards) is now the single rule; all other sites updated to match.
- **Export paths.** `skills/continue/SKILL.md` export branch now says "writes directly into work_dir" (no copy step), matching `skills/memo/SKILL.md` Phase 11. `skills/legal-memo-style/SKILL.md` now uses `$WORK_DIR/memo-<slug>.docx` (previously the obsolete `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/work/<task_id>/final/` path).
- **`fallback_banners[]` rendered in docx.** `scripts/md_to_docx.py:add_warning_banner` now reads `state.json.fallback_banners[]` via the new `extract_fallback_banners()` function and renders each entry as a bullet in a "Pipeline fallbacks that fired during this run" sub-section of the warning banner. The banner now fires even when `final_status` starts with `approved`, as long as fallback_banners is non-empty (covers MCP-rate-limited + success and similar cases). `fallback_summary_delivered` final_status gets a custom title `RESEARCH SUMMARY MODE — IRAC ANALYSIS NOT PERFORMED`.
- **Widget paths.** 11 hardcoded `work/<task_id>/widgets/` references in `skills/memo/SKILL.md` are now `$WORK_DIR/widgets/`, honoring the resolved working directory. Two `work/<task_id>/cache/` references also migrated.
- **New `skills/memo/references/pipeline-contract.md`** is the canonical phase table + state schema + tool inheritance + validator contract + file-link UX + WebSearch policy + release hygiene. All other docs now cite this file instead of restating.

### Release hygiene

- New `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root (this file).
- `README.md` version bumped from the stale `0.0.2` to `0.0.38`.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version bumped from `0.0.37` to `0.0.38`.
- Future releases follow the atomic procedure in `pipeline-contract.md §Release hygiene`.

## 0.0.37 and earlier

No formal changelog was maintained for prior releases. `dist/legal-memo-writer-<version>.zip` archives capture the binary state for versions 0.0.17 through 0.0.37. Reconstruct from `git log` if needed.
